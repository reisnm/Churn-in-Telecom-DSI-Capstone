### **Capstone Project - Churn in Telecom - Data Science Immersive - General Assembly**

**Definition and objectives**

Churn, in business, refers to a number of customers who stop using a companyâ€™s service. Churn rate is defined by calculating the number of users in the beginning of a certain period (A) minus the number of users in the end of this period (B)  and dividing this result by the number of users in the beginning ((A-B)/B).
Is well known that it is more costly to get a new client than keeping an existing one. Analysing churn rate is essential for customer retention, therefore for a business health, helping to identify and evaluate how customers use your product and as well define techniques for retention.

This project was executed using data from a telecom company in the United States in 2009 and it aimed to predict how likely customers were to end the contract with the company, identify who they were and what services they use, in order to define them as targets for retention strategies and as well, provide recommendations for such strategies.
